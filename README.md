Wings but with OSC

Unity prefabs for controlling your wings, tail, far-too-long-taur-body using the magic of OSC and the unused Index touchpads.

Requires [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/) and one of the OSC sender applications listed below.

Or you can install manually if you're used to that.

TO USE:
- Check the readme in the unitypackage.
- If there is none, you should generally just drag the "OSC Prefab" onto your scene.
- Clear your VRChat OSC Settings and give it a try.
