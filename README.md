Wings but with OSC

This unity prefab is a drop-in replacement animator for Morghus' ZDragon Wings package.

It adds OSC control for each wing, utilizing https://github.com/KadachiiVR/knuckles_to_osc

This should work with any "ZDragon Wings" asset listed on this gumroad, including for other species: https://morghus.gumroad.com/
